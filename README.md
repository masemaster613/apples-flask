Making a web app for playing the classic card game Apples to Apples. It currently works well through all the stages, but does not handle errors well, such as someone signing in late or the game ending.

Just added the ability to start a new game without restarting the program. If someone logs in late, they can start a new game. Will try to add joining the game in progres next.
